# My Language Translator

**My Language Translator** is a web application designed to facilitate translation and transcription between multiple languages. The application uses advanced machine learning models to handle the translation process and supports various input languages. For instance, if you input text in **English** and specify **Hindi** as the target language, it will provide the translated text in **Hindi**. This application mimics the functionality of well-known translation services like **Google Translate**.

## Features:

- **Text Translation**: Translate text between multiple languages.
- **Transcription**: Transcribe audio or text from one language to another.
- **Real-time Translation**: Instantly shows the translation as soon as the input is given.
- **Supports Multiple Languages**: Built to support multiple languages, with future enhancements to cover more languages.

## Technologies Used in Development:

This project is built with the following technologies:

1. **HTML**: For the structure and markup of the web pages.
2. **CSS**: For styling and improving the user interface (UI).
3. **JavaScript (JS)**: For interactive behavior and enhancing the user experience (UX).
4. **Flask**: A Python-based web framework used to handle backend logic and API interactions.

## Models Used:

The application utilizes the following pre-trained machine learning models for translation and transcription:

1. **facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M**: A multilingual model capable of translating across over 200 languages.
2. **facebook/mms-tts**: A Text-to-Speech (TTS) model for generating speech from text in various languages.
